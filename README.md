# Business-Intelligence-on-Ed-Tech-Data

An ed tech company manages to sell a lot of online courses across different countries and thousands of users. 

These courses are from different sectors starting from Business category, there are courses from Finance, Entrepreneurship, Communication, Management, Sales, Strategy, Operations, Project Management, Business Law, Data & Analytics, Home Business, Human Resources and Industry each having multiple courses under its domain.

My goal is to provide a complete analysis about their sales distribution, consumer demands, revenue generated etc, with proper data visuals and DTC dashboard at the end in Tableau.
